    /*
        a. Sammyâ€™s Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes,
        beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. In Chapter 2, you wrote an application that prompts the user for the number of minutes a piece of sports
        equipment was rented, displays the company motto with a border, and
        displays the price for the rental. Now modify the program so that the main()
        method contains only three executable statements that each call a method
        as follows:
        The first executable statement calls a method that prompts the user for
        the rental time in minutes and returns the value to the main() method.
        The second executable statement calls a method that displays the company motto with the border.
        The last executable statement passes the number of minutes to a method
        that computes the hours, extra minutes, and price for the rental, and then
        displays all the details.
