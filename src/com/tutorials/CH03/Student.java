public class Student

    /*
        (a)Create a class named Student. A Student has fields for an ID number, number of
        credit hours earned, and number of points earned. (For example, many schools
        compute grade point averages based on a scale of 4, so a three-credit-hour class in
        which a student earns an A is worth 12 points.) Include methods to assign values
        to all fields. A Student also has a field for grade point average. Include a method to
        compute the grade point average field by dividing points by credit hours earned.
        Write methods to display the values in each Student field. Save this class as
        Student.java.

        (b) Write a class named ShowStudent that instantiates a Student object from the
            class you created and assign values to its fields. Compute the Student grade point
            average, and then display all the values associated with the Student. Save the
            application as ShowStudent.java.

        (c) Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should
            initialize each Studentâ€™s ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and
            credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that
            demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying
            the initial values. Save the application as ShowStudent2.java.
