    /*
        Open a new file in your text editor, and start a class that will demonstrate
        a working two-dimensional array:
        import java.util.Scanner;
        class TwoDimensionalArrayDemo
        {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {

        2. Declare a three-by-three array of integers. By default, the elements will all be
        initialized to 0.
        int[][] count = new int[3][3];
        3. Declare a Scanner object for input, variables to hold a row and column,
        and a constant that can be used to indicate when the user wants to quit
        the application.
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int row, column;
        final int QUIT = 99;
        4. Prompt the user to enter a row or the QUIT value to quit, then accept the
        userâ€™s input.
        System.out.print("Enter a row or " + QUIT +
        " to quit > ");
        row = input.nextInt();
        5. In a loop that continues if the user has not entered the QUIT value, prompt the
        user for a column. If the row and column are both within appropriate ranges,
        add 1 to the element in the selected position.
        while(row != QUIT)
        {
        System.out.print("Enter a column > ");
        column = input.nextInt();
        if(row < count.length && column < count[row].length)
        {
        count[row][column]++;
        6. Still within the if statement that checks for a valid row and column, add a
        nested loop that displays each row and column of the newly incremented
        array. The elements in each row are displayed on the same line, and a new
        line is started at the end of each row. Add a closing curly brace for the
        if statement.
        for(int r = 0; r < count.length; ++r)
        {
        for(int c = 0; c < count[r].length; ++c)
        System.out.print(count[r][c] + " ");
        System.out.println();
        }
        }
        7. Add an else clause to the if statement to display an error message when the
        row or column value is too high.
        else
        System.out.println("Invalid position selected");

        8. At the end of the loop, prompt the user for and accept the next row number.
        Add closing curly braces for the loop, the main() method, and the class.
        System.out.print("Enter a row or " + QUIT +
        " to quit > ");
        row = input.nextInt();
        }
        }
        }
        9. Save the file as TwoDimensionalArrayDemo.java. Compile and execute
        the program. Figure 9-14 shows a typical execution. As the user continues to
        enter row and column values, the appropriate elements in the array are
        incremented.
