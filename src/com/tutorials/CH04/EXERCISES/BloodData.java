    /*
        a.  Create a class named BloodData that includes fields that hold a blood type (the
            four blood types are O, A, B, and AB) and an Rh factor (the factors are + and –).
            Create a default constructor that sets the fields to “O” and “+”, and an overloaded
            constructor that requires values for both fields. Include get and set methods for
            each field. Save this file as BloodData.java. Create an application named
            TestBloodData that demonstrates each method works correctly. Save the
            application as TestBloodData.java.
